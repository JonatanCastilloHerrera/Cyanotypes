# Cyanotypes
The cyanotype is a photographic printing process that uses a UV light source. In this process, the ferric salt in the sensitizer solution is reduced to a ferrous state, forming an insoluble blue compound known as Prussian blue (ferric ferrocyanide). Well-exposed areas develop a wide dynamic range of blue tones.

This app is designed to calculate the exposure time for a point light source by applying the inverse-square law.
