# Cyanotypes
Cyanotype is a photographic printing process that involves the chemical reaction between ferric ammonium citrate and potassium ferricyanide. 

Upon exposure to ultraviolet light, typically from the sun, the ferric ion in the solution is reduced to a ferrous ion, forming a blue compound known as Prussian blue (ferric ferrocyanide). The areas exposed to light turn blue, while the unexposed areas remain white. This process results in a distinctive blue-toned image, making cyanotype a popular method in alternative photography.
