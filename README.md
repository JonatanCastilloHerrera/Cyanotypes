# Cyanotypes
Cyanotype is a photographic printing process that involves the chemical reaction between ferric ammonium citrate and potassium ferricyanide. When mixed together, these chemicals form a light-sensitive solution. The process begins by coating a surface, such as paper or fabric, with this solution and allowing it to dry in the dark. Upon exposure to ultraviolet light, typically from the sun, the ferric ion in the solution is reduced to a ferrous ion, forming a blue compound known as Prussian blue (ferric ferrocyanide). The areas exposed to light turn blue, while the unexposed areas remain white. This process results in a distinctive blue-toned image, making cyanotype a popular method in alternative photography.
